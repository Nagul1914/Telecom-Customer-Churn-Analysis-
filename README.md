# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical customer data, we identify key factors influencing churn and build predictive models to improve customer retention strategies.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `Telecom-Customer-Churn.csv` - Dataset used for analysis.
- `Telecom-Churn-Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model building.
- `Telecom-Churn-Presentation.pptx` - Summary of findings and insights.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## 📊 Key Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer behavior.
- Identify key features contributing to customer churn.
- Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict churn.
- Provide actionable insights for telecom businesses to improve customer retention.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for implementation
- **Machine Learning** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- **PowerPoint** for presentation

## 📈 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost
- Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution of churn and non-churn customers
- Correlation analysis between features
- Customer behavior trends and patterns

## 🎯 Insights & Recommendations
- Identified high-risk customer segments prone to churn.
- Suggested targeted retention strategies based on feature importance.
- Demonstrated the effectiveness of predictive modeling in reducing churn rates.
